# Movie Recommendation System

Welcome to the **Movie Recommendation System** project! This repository contains the code and resources for a content-based movie recommender system developed using cosine similarity. The system is designed to provide personalized movie recommendations based on user preferences and is deployed as a web application using Streamlit.

## Project Overview

The **Movie Recommendation System** is an innovative tool that leverages the power of machine learning to suggest movies to users based on their input. By analyzing text-based features like genres, plot descriptions, and cast, the system identifies and recommends movies that are similar to those the user enjoys.

### Key Features

- **Cosine Similarity Algorithm**: 
  - Utilizes a content-based filtering approach to compare movie features and recommend those most aligned with user preferences.
  - Efficiently handles the multidimensional data of movie attributes to provide accurate and relevant suggestions.

- **Streamlit Deployment**:
  - The system is deployed as an interactive web application using Streamlit.
  - Offers a simple, intuitive interface that makes it easy for users to input their favorite movies and receive real-time recommendations.

- **Data Handling**:
  - Processes and manages a comprehensive dataset of movies.
  - Ensures the accuracy of recommendations by meticulously extracting and utilizing relevant features from the data.

- **User Interface**:
  - Designed with user experience in mind, the interface is responsive and user-friendly.
  - Allows users to seamlessly interact with the system, inputting their preferences and exploring tailored movie recommendations.

## Getting Started

To get a local copy of the project up and running, follow these simple steps:

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7+
- Streamlit
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn

### Dataset

You can download the dataset used for this project [here]( https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tmdb/tmdb-movie-metadata) (replace `#` with the actual URL).

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/levi1775/movierecommendation.git

2. Navigate to the project directory:

### Explanation:

- **Each Command is in a Code Block**: 
  - `git clone`, `cd movierecommendation`, `pip install -r requirements.txt`, and `streamlit run app.py` are all commands that users will need to run in their terminal.
  - They are each enclosed in triple backticks (\`\`\`) to format them as code blocks, which makes the commands easy to copy and paste.

- **Sequential Steps**: 
  - Each step is numbered, creating a logical flow that guides the user from cloning the repository to running the application.

This formatting ensures that every command is presented clearly, making your README easy to follow for anyone setting up your project.
